# PumpManifesto
> Because without a PumpManifesto, every moonshot risks becoming just another rug

We are the **pumpsters**. When the charts sleep and the code hums low, when midnight nodes glow and wallets whisper, we read each other’s signals and remember why we came here.

We did not come here to get rich alone. We came here to lift together — to find degens who laugh at risk, who build silly art and serious projects, who code, design, sing, and meme until the idea itself travels. The coin is the drum; the project is the march. We pump to rally, not to rob.

So hear this, in the reckless, honest voice of every late-night builder and trader:

1. No rug shall be pulled by the dev. A developer’s wallet is for work and trust, not for early exits. Dev wallets must remain locked or remain unsold until the community has had a fair chance to exit or the project has delivered its promise. If trust is the currency, we will not bankrupt it for transient profit.

2. We aim to win — to go to the moon with the community behind the coin — not to chase profit alone. Our north star is the project: utility, art, culture, or chaos that lasts longer than a single pump. If the project thrives, the rest follows.

3. We are not financial advisers. We offer no product that guarantees profit, no investment service, no guidance that substitutes for your own judgment. We are a club of curious degens, creators, and misfits who gather around a shared interest. Trade at your own risk. Learn. Laugh. Build.

4. We will not coordinate market manipulation that harms others. We will not conspire to deceive retail players or exploit information asymmetry. Pumping together does not mean cheating together.

5. Transparency is sacred. Roadmaps, major wallet movements, and critical team decisions should be visible to the community. If secrets are needed for security, explain them later. Secrecy breeds suspicion; openness breeds belonging.

6. We celebrate creativity more than price. Memes, music, code, art drops, and community stunts matter. The loudest pump is often the one that made folks smile and stay.

7. We accept volatility and the possibility of loss. We accept that some who join us will lose. We will try to educate, not exploit; to signal, not to mislead.

8. If a team member breaks the pact, the community will respond — with censure, governance, and removal when needed. Reputation matters; it is our shared ledger.

9. We will build tools, not traps. Contracts should be auditable; liquidity should be locked or community-governed when possible; important binaries and media should be archived and verifiable.

10. Above all: be human. Treat newcomers like collaborators, not marks. If you have knowledge, share it. If you spot a scam, shout it. If you build something beautiful, release it.

**We write this not as holy writ but as a promise: that together we will chase the moon without burning the house down. If you sign on, sign with your memes — and remember the simplest truth: a moonshot with no friends is just an empty sky.**
